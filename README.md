## 20 - Speech Detection
- This task was a real challenge. Not for itself, but because I've had a lot of trouble with the use of the mic with the Live Server.
- In the end, it was a very useful task because I learned to generate a private key and a CSR with OpenSSL and to configure https on the Live Server extension.

- It was quite a challenge
