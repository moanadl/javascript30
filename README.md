# JavaScript30 Challenge

This repository was created to store all the exercises I am doing from the JavaScript30 Challenge. I am using this challenge to perfect my skills on JavaScript Vanilla and learn new things and tools.

# Main learning points

## 01 - Drum kit
- .tagName
- .getAttribute
- .e.type (identify the event type)
- .currentTime = 0 (restart audio file)

## 02 - CSS and JS Clock
- .clearInterval()
- Transform-origin
- Audio only plays after there is an interaction with the page. It doesn't initiates with the setInterval alone

## 03 - Playing with CSS Variables and JS
- Watching the solution shown in the video I've discovered the document.documentElement, although I haven't used it in my solution.
